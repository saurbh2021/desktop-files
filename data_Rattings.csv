The app interface is straight to point.
I primarily use it for calories counter and sleep tracker.
It also has BP and Oxegen monitor as well which can be handily not for accurate use.

For 2.5k it is ok but don't spend much on these watches if you are looking for some serious lifestyle. Just use it for casual fitness tracker for basics.

Pros:
1. The watch is lightweight & has slightly premium look.
2. The battery life is good, It lasts more than a week if you don't record any activity & a week if any activities are recorded. (Auto heart rate monitor on & with wake up gesture on)
3. The apps gives good amount of the info about the daily exercise, sleep, and heart rate.
4. The OS is simple.

2. Display brightness is good for outdoor
3. Not many watchfaces in realme link app for this watch
4. Tracking not accurate, it will increase step count whether you are just chilling at couch üòÇ.
5. Whatsapp, YouTube, incoming call notifications are working fine.
6. Vibration is decent.
7. Raise to wake up doesn't work properly.

Overall doesn't worth 3k",

191,5,"First day first sale product and the watch is amazing. The design and build quality is good not the best but for the price it's justify able. The important thing is the features it provides. The step count and activity tracker is not accurate to be honest but rest everything works perfectly fine. It's not a major upgrade from Realme Watch or the watch s and watch s master edition. But as a new product it's okay. The realme watch , watch 2 , watch s and watch watch s master edition all are sam...",
192,5,"Under 3k price segment, Realme watch 2 worth every penny because of it's compact design, 1.4 inch (340*340) bright (600 nit, 323 ppi) display, All type of sports mode (90), accurate monitoring of heart rate, SpO2, Sleep time monitoring & upto 12 days battery backup (fast charging) for regular uses.",

194,5,"Best option under 2,999.Spo2 and heart rate working good and watch is really fast in sync as soon as you get notification in your phone without any lag watch also receive msg (same time notification).

* Fast synchronization with your phone
* Value for money",
195,5,"perfect watch at this price segment
amazing display tauch experience
Battery backup also Superb
90 sport mode which is extremely amazing because this types of 90 supports mode not available in other brand....

(Happy With Realme Watch 2)",
196,4,"I'm writing this review after 48hrs of use. I'm not promoting the sale of company. This is the honest one I'm writing which I found after the use.

pros:-
1. Heart rate & spo2 sensor are 85%-90% accurate(improvement needed
2. By switch into a sports mode it can give a better result if the watch is connected to your phone and your phone gps is on.
3. sleep tracking is also good but can be better by improving the algorithm & software. its 75% accurate.
4. Built quality, colour saturation is up ...",
197,3,"Didn't like much.....
Points to consider-
1. Good battery life - 15% down after using 1 day (24 hours)
2. Display brightness is good for outdoor
3. Not many watchfaces in realme link app for this watch
4. Tracking not accurate, it will increase step count whether you are just chilling at couch üòÇ.
5. Whatsapp, YouTube, incoming call notifications are working fine.
6. Vibration is decent.
7. Raise to wake up doesn't work properly.

I bought this watch as a secondary watch and I got amazed by its accuracy in Step Tracking.
It counts each step you take, one by one and you can see each step getting updated on watch screen!
I've turned on Smart Heart Rate 'always on' and the Battery lasts for 7-8 days.
Heart Rate & SPO2 reading matches with Oxymeter I have. (with 1% deviation on both devices - which is normal)
Heart Rate is even in sync with a Omron BP device I have.

42,5,"It is a stunning watch. Feels well-built, metal casing, the strap is also nice, soft. The highlight is the display of this watch. The AMOLED display is smooth and the watch performs well in direct sunlight as well. All sensors work perfectly. There are thousands of watch faces available in the app, most of the faces are very nice to look at. It monitors heartbeat continuously as well and is quite accurate. The SpO2 sensor is also fine. Overall a great buy for the price.

43,3,"good one.
i felt like the touch seansitivity is not up to the mark, sensor also not up to the mark ie the sensors are not correctly detecting the watch motion all the time(this i felt in the case when the watch display on when we shake)

battery life 2 weeks

build quality is nice and deisgn also looks good",
44,5,"Infact this is my first smart watch buy after so much of research. The fit and finish of the product is good and design is exemplary. The only feature missed out was calling function but all future purchasers should accept it and go for it. Battery backup is awesome simply 10 plus days.
Will definitely go for a future upgrade through Huawei only..!!!",
45,3,"Watch is stylish and does decent measurement of steps and distance. Battery doesnt last long as they guaranteed. It only lasts for 5 days with moderate usage.
Not satisfied with battery life.
Also not great measurements on other sports modes. Just measures active minutes, heart rate and calories.",
46,5,"This watch is amazing. Battery Life is awesome you don't need to charge it every day. Strap colour is cool. Screen quality is awesome in sunlight. The only problem I had is packaging of flipkart is poor as compared to Amazon.
Overall 9/10 stars.
Must purchase product and genuine seller must say as their dealings are good with customers.
Very good keep it up.",
47,5,Great product it is. Liked the design and battery back up especially. Hoping to have Integration with strava soon. Looks like Huawei is working in that. Android App is having more features compared to the iOS version of huawei Heath App. Huawei has to work on that to make iOS users happy. Overall worth the money spent!,
48,4,"Awesome watch in the price bracket. I got 8days backup.
Display and connectivity is superb
If you don't own a Huawei phone I guess some features like remote shutter will not be available

You need to download Huawei app gallery , health and HMS core ans then pair the watch' with non Huawei phone

Also I noticed that the auto detect workout feature does not work.

All good from Flipkart end..",

Downside is that there are no app store and you need to deal with only inbuilt apps and features. Battery life is great too.

We totally have 9 laptops of the same model and configuration, all used for our Interns. All purchased between Jan - Jun 2021.
Initially the laptops were very good and the best in the price range.
Oflate the last two purchases were seriously bad. The recent one did not even boot !
I am now struggling to replace / return.

ASUS started making worst quality laptops of this model now, since last one month or so.

180,,"Update: 15.07.2021:
STOP PURCHASING THIS MODEL !
ASUS started cheating !

We totally have 9 laptops of the same model and configuration, all used for our Interns. All purchased between Jan - Jun 2021.
Initially the laptops were very good and the best in the price range.
Oflate the last two purchases were seriously bad. The recent one did not even boot !
I am now struggling to replace / return.

ASUS started making worst quality laptops of this model now, since last one month or so.

STOP PURC...",
181,,"Its my review after used after 5 months.
Its not a valuable laptop for study or any smooth working purposes.
Issues:
1. Connectivity issues I m facing now. Specially usb port.
2. Battary performance was well for first 3 months. After it drains quickly without any playing video or audio. Only pdf reading it running hardly 2 hrs.
3. web camera is very bad performing like 0.3mp.
4. The processor also very slow and sometimes its hanging that one can't move for other work.
5. In sunlight one ...",
182,,"Just an okay product.. Its a month now and these are my feedback.
Performance is okay for people use to surf and watch films.
Quality is average.. tapping on mouse pad is like tapping on cardboards. I expected a bit more quality.
Few irritants are no capslock light.. u have no idea if the caps is on or not, especially when u type passwords.. other one is the on/off button.. this is just like another key on keyboard without light again.. if the screen lits up only then u could realise the syst...",

184,,"Laptop is good for kids ..school or secondary laptop for movies and also for older folks who just need connectivity.. like skype and social.
For 17k this is a good deal. 1TB for storage and 4GB ram does the light lifting.
Dont expect this to do any fancy gaming or programs..what you pay and the purpose is key before selecting this laptop",
185,,"overall good... value for the price ...but not for heavy works .. it's ok for basic works like web browsing, emails, office works - excell, word etc.",
186,,"The webcam quality for video calls is very bad
And it takes aloot of time to open each file or folder
And the display quality is not good.
For basic kids use only .
only look wise its good
Don't buy better add little more money and buy i3/i5",
187,,Best laptop in given prize range..battery was gud but processor running slow..overall laptop was good for simple works,

193,,I am happy with this laptop. Good for basic use at home. Good for kid's use also. Battery is good - runs more than 4-5 hours. Not happy with Display and no caps lock and number log indicator light.,
194,,I have just received the laptop today and am very excited to use it.Must say that at this price range it's one of the best laptops to buy without thinking once.Must buy if you want a decent work laptop with good specifications at this price range.,

and we are thinking about display quality it's good you can also play video upto 4K on youtube but first of all I think display quality is very poor cause of TFT panel but wrong TFT panel is also good but not like that IPS .

When you use it for office work then download WPS office it's good and featur...",

Reading text on this is quite nice. You can load the desktop version of Flipkart on this and see everything clearly.

5"" clear bright ips screen. Even on lowest brightness it is quite nice. Does not get hot even on 3G.

Reading text on this is quite nice. You can load the desktop version of Flipkart on this and see everything clearly.

- Very good build quality.
- Cable length is accurate and tangle free.
- Clear Vocals.
- Loudness is very adequate.
- Mic is of superior quality. Calls are great.
- Looks very premium due to real wooden structure.

Cons.

- Bass isn't present as much as competitors. Making it ironic as these are called 'Bassbuds'.

I am using it for only meetings in laptop
I am not using it in phone

Good

- sound quality is good
- wire looks like tangle free
- nice case

Bad

- no volume button. Its a slider, won't work efficiently
- for me i feel length too much..
- two ear buds are identical and always need to see which is right and left and put


Total rating.

I would suggest people to buy it for 300rs.. Very much worthy.. Better then Sony and Philips which comes in this price",

8,3,The product is nice very lite feels cheap plastic and very fragile.the signal strength is very good and the speed its giving is also good but the setting not that easy you have do a lot of setting to properly setup like dns and security protocols of tkip and ies something took me time most of the router came with setting already but not this i got it for 995 so it is a steal a deal for me,D-Link DIR-819 750 Mbps Router Reviews

1. D-Link 819 it's a dual band router 2.4 and 5 but the thing is for longer distances 5 gigahertz range not connected. 2.4 gigahertz range covered maximum 1.5bhk room not more than that.

I'll try to answer all questions I was looking for, maybe it'll hep others.

1. Flipkart service great as always. Packing was okay (instead of wrapping in bubble wrap it was wrapped in small piece of carton due to which box got little damaged) but delivery time was excellent. Delivered in 2 days.

168,4,The dual antenna doesn't provide any significant improvement in signal strength. The net speed is excellent comparedto an N router. Happy with the product.,
169,5,The wifi is working perfectly well for me.It is very easy to configure with the ip address.This needs double configuration since it has two networks and one of them is 5G.The speed is excellent and so is the covering range.,
170,5,This router it seems is a basic gigabit router which can handle multiple devices at home and for home wifi. Speed has definitely increased as i wanted to be sure that my ISP was not bluffing about the advertised speed and my internet plan for which i am paying money.After I set this one up over the older router of the same company and was almost 7 years old (Tp Link 740 wrn 150) the speed has definitely increased almost about 3 times. While 5ghz speed is really good at a shorter distance near...,
171,5,Wonderful experience so far.This provides more than enough coverage for a small home or a normal flat / apartment as long as you place it properly in the middle of the house. File transfers in the home network maxes out around 400Mbps( in the 5gig band) so far in my tests. USB file sharing also works seamlessly as long as you are using a Windows laptop/PC. Since it comes with an option to wall mount it saves some space for you too.,
172,5,"Excellent router. Using it for a week now. The coverage is excellent. I have a 4 bhk house. Covers the entire house except a little area in the farthest room. No drops in connection witnessed as of now. The 5g band gives the best speed but its coverage area is less than the 2.4g band. I have a 40mbps plan and using the 5g band, the speed test shows the exact speed.
Overall would recommend this router as it is comparatively very cheap at 1899. Better go with this than the 2 antenna routers.",
173,5,"I am a streamer as well as a gamer , this product is really nice ideal for new streamers and budget gamers . love tp link product",
174,5,"The router is good, but the horrible part is the network works only in 2.4ghz if connected to 5Ghz after 10 mins the network goes very slow, like there is no material network gauge by it. Where in if connected to 2.4g back again it works. Firstly range is dam low for 5G and it doesn't work properly. Figuring this out after 14 days is observation",
175,5,"Works great. The ranges of both bands are good. 4 antennae helps with that. The UI of the router website is very clean for a quick setup. Guest network is also available. Low end phones might not capture the 5Mhz band. Check if your mobiles support 5Mhz. My Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 doesn't support but the Nokia 7 plus does! You have to be careful on that.

178,5,"Was skeptical to choose between c20 vs c50. Many websites n reviews voted c20. But if you go to tplink India site, n compare c20 vs c50, c5o is better because it has beamforming technology which c20 don't hv.

This is very important. When you want a better coverage n reach. I hv alliance with 60 mbps connection, n in the same room I get about 56-57 mbps in wifi. . One floor above even 6 devices atached can watch hd movies without any bufffer........ I constantly getting 30-35 mbps..

182,5,The Range is Great and the speed is also very good. No loss in speed even at greater ranges.. perfect value for money and the features that it provides is also excellent... The wifi interface is also very simple and easy.. You get your Wifi Tether app on your phone to control your router configuration.. Setting up Guest mode is the best feature that many other routers lag.. No USB Port that's for sure but still I don't need it....,

Pros:
1) I get consistent 90Mbps on my ACT 90Mbps connection while my router sits in another room with a wall between.

4) No disconnection seen in...",
184,5,I think it‚Äôs a nice router. I have not faced a single issue of mishaps with this one compared to my last router D-Link. This gives a stable connection and no need to sign in repeatedly for internet service like Tikona unless you didn‚Äôt done the setup. Overall good worth of every penny .,
185,5,"fantastic beast... covers my area of 3bedrooms with terrace. I've used it for 3days almost continuously, still no heating. although it is not advised to use the device for more than 24hrs without giving it a rest, to ensure maximum life.
